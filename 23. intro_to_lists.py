# Collection = A Complex data type, or container data types. 

# Lists are used to store multiple values of the same types. 

# empty_list = [] <-- This is an empty list!

# uk_cities = ['London', 'Liverpool', 'Manchester', 'Sunderland', 'Cambridge', 'York']
# print(uk_cities)

# Elements in a list are numbered and indexed. List's start at 0!

uk_cities = ['London', 'Liverpool', 'Manchester', 'Sunderland', 'Cambridge', 'York']
uk_cities[0] # This will print London. This is called indexing. 

# if you use -1, it will be York. The last element in the list. 
# uk_cities[0:2] First and Second elements only. London and Liverpool only. 
# uk_cities[2:] Start at two to end. cities_uk[:3] starts at 0 and goes as far as 3.
