# A loop is used to repeat an instruction once or a number of times. 
# Two basic loops, while and for. 

# while condition:
#    do_something()
#    do_something2()

counter = 1
while counter < 11: # increase the counter until we get to 11. 
    print(counter)
    counter += 1 # This increments the value by 1. Incrimentaion. 
print('Finished!')

# Print from 1 to 10. When it gets to 10, print Finished. 

# Infinate loops never end. The Condition is always true.
