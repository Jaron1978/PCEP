# This is some basic Python code using everything Ive learnt in the last couple of lessons. I will be adding Comments to show what Ive leanrt and what the code does. 

print('This is a brief line of code showcasing what Ive picked up so far.\nThis will include a line break and I\'m also going to showcase the escape charecter. ')

# The code above prints the the line of text or string. The line break (\n) literally breaks the line and moves the second line of text to a new line.
# The escape (\) allows me to use the ' without impacting the string.
