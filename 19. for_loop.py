# For loops are used to go through elements of a specific sequence.
# Sequences are special data structures that can store more than one value and can be browsed sequentialy. 
# A String is a sequence type. Hello is a sequence of Charecters. 

# for letter in 'Hello!': # letter is the variable. 
#     print('Current Letter', letter) # Iterations. 

# This will print Hello! sequentialy. 

counter = 1
for counter in range (1,11):
    print(counter)
print('Finished')

# Multiple versions of range. 
# Single Number - Default of 0 to start (0 to 10)
# Two Numbers is start and stop
# Three Numbers (1, 11, 2) 0 to 10 and every second number, so 1,3,5,7,9
