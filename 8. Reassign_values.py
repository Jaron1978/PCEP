# age = 28 -> Comment out to use code later on. 
# print(age) 

# This will print 28

# new_age = age + 2 -> Comment out to use code later on. 

# Printing new_age will be 30. This is age + 2. 

# age = 28
# age = age +7
# print(age)

# The above line of code can also be written as: 

# age = 28
# age += 7 
# print(age) # The += is adding the origional age 28 to the 7 to equal 35. 

# age *= 2 is age times 2, age -= 5 means subtract 5, age /= 3 is current value divided by 3

# String concatenation means to join strings: 
# text = 'hokus ' + 'pokus'
# print(text)

print('Hello ' * 5) # Prints Hello 5 times.
