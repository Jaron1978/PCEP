# Unary Operator:
# print(+12) # This will print 12

# The order of Operators: 
# 1. **
# 2. * / // %
# 3. + -

print(2 + 3 * 2) # Starts with 3 X 2 then adds 2
print(2 + 3)* 2 # This equals 10. 2 + 3 = 5, X by 2. 

# Exponentation Operator ** always starts from the right. 
# 2 ** 2 ** 3 = 256 ( 2  ** 3 = 8, then 2 ** 8 = 256)
